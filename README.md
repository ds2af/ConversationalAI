# Disaster Tweet Classification using Hierarchial Conversational AI
This github includes the code for our disaster tweet classification framework.  The following files are included:
  * Final_Azure_Experiments: this folder holds the experiements using the AzureAI GPT models
  * data: this folder holds the test and train data
  * BERT_Experiments: this folder holds the experiments using the BERT model
  * Hybrid_Approach: Code for hybrid approach



### How to Configure and Run
 1) Create depolyments for GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o-2 in AzureAI
 2) Obtain API key from AzureAI
 3) Store the API key in a text file titled: api_key.txt
 4) Place the api_key.txt in the respective folder of the model you want to run
 5) Open the terminal
 6) To run the model, type **python [python_filename]**

Note: to run the BERT model, you can open the .ipynb file and run all the cells.
